# Coding Style Preferences

## General
- Use descriptive variable names
- Keep functions small and focused (under 20 lines when possible)
- Prefer early returns over nested conditionals
- Write self-documenting code; add comments only for complex logic

## JavaScript/TypeScript
- Use functional components for React
- Prefer `const` over `let`, never use `var`
- Use arrow functions for callbacks
- Always use semicolons
- Use single quotes for strings
- Destructure objects and arrays when it improves readability

## Formatting
- 2 spaces for indentation
- Max line length: 100 characters
- Always add trailing commas in multi-line arrays/objects
- Use Prettier for consistent formatting

## Naming Conventions
- camelCase for variables and functions
- PascalCase for classes and React components
- SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Prefix boolean variables with `is`, `has`, `should`, `can`
